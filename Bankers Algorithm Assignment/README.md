# Banker's algorithm

## The banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that checks for safety by simulating allocation for predetermined maximum possible quantities of all resources, then performing a "s-state" search to check for possible activities before determining whether allocation should be allowed to proceed.

## Input
- Number of processe
- number of resources
- Detail
-  Max
- Available Resources
- New Request Details
- Request for Resources 

## Output
- SYSTEM IS IN UNSAFE STATE
- SYSTEM IS IN SAFE STATE  and display the safe seqence.
