The algorithm Shortest Job First (SJF) selects the process with the shortest execution time for the next execution. This form of scheduling can be either preemptive or non-preemptive. It greatly decreases the total time spent waiting for other processes to complete. SJF stands for Shortest Job First in its full form.

Advantages –
*Shortest jobs are favored.
It is provably optimal, in that it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes.



Disadvantages –
*SJF may cause starvation, if shorter processes keep coming. This problem is solved by aging.
*It cannot be implemented at the level of short term CPU scheduling.
