Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.
 
Advantages of Paging
*Easy to use memory management algorithm
*No need for external Fragmentation
*Swapping is easy between equal-sized pages and page frames.


Disadvantages of Paging

*May cause Internal fragmentation
*Complex memory management algorithm
*Page tables consume additonal memory.
*Multi-level paging may lead to memory reference overhead.
